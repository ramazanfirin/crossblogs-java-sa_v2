Challenge Statement

Cross-blogs is a backend blogging application written by a startup company called WritingForAll. It allows users to create / update / delete their articles, accepting comments for each article.

Notes:
- Articles have a 120 character limit for their title, and a 32k limit for their body.
- The frontend application is excluded from the current scope. It is a separate, fully-functional application handled by another team, so we do not want to modify it by performing any API modifications.


Your tasks:
- Increase unit test coverage to reach 70%, achieving more than 70% will only consume your valuable time without extra score.
- Find bugs and fix them, hint: we provided Cross-Blogs application in a good structure, so no need to spend your valuable time on structure modifications,  just focus on fixing bugs.
- Articles search title endpoint is very slow, please optimize it.
